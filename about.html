      <strong>Design Convergences</strong><br/>
      Dissolving boundaries, building connections
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology and design keep redefining the relationship between us and the world where we live, disclosing unknown territories full of new exciting possibilities and behaviours. It’s a constant flow of change that invests us as individuals, the objects we use everyday, the environment where our life takes place, the information we consume, as well as social dynamics and politics. Interaction Week 18 wants to reflect on how technology and design are shaping the world moving forward by building bridges across cultures, disciplines and industries and pointing to shared directions and goals. It’s now just a matter of what interaction design can do to improve our future lives but also why we want to be part of this flow and what role we want to play within it.

      We want to hear contributions about how technology has been changing the relations with ourselves and what is going to happen with a more pervasive presence of digital identities and user-generated data. We want to hear how technology has redefined the relations with objects, and how the raise of artificial intelligences on one side and mixed analog and digital realities on the other will extend humans’ possibilities. We want to talk about how we relate with the environment where we live and reflect on the virtuous paths that can improve in a smart, responsible and sustainable way our experience of the city and of all the key services we need for living, from health to finance, transport, education and inclusivity. We want to reflect on how technology is disrupting the relationship with information, society and politics, adopting a more systemic perspective on what has been happening around us in the recent years and what to expect moving forward.

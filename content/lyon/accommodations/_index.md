Lyon offers a rich variety of accommodation choices, in the city centre or downtown, in a contemporary hotel or a classical 17<sup>th</sup> century apartment.

For Interaction&nbsp;Week&nbsp;18 we are looking for some of the best places for you.

You will find in Mama Shelter a place that blends into one of the central quarters of Lyon but at the same time has a charm of its own. Minimal yet eccentric, luxurious yet affordable – everything is enriched with an urban touch.

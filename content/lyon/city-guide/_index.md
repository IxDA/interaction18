## We love Lyon.

In fact we love it so much we compiled a guide to the best things to do, see, eat and experience in our home city.

To make this list we asked, well, everyone. We asked our Core Team, we asked our volunteers, we asked everyone we knew who was familiar with Lyon. Below you’ll find the results: Lyon’s finest attractions from restaurants serving the famous cuisine Lyonnaise to world renowned sites of historical significance.

We hope you enjoy this guide and the recommendations within. We are positive that by the end of your stay, you’ll love Lyon every bit as much as us.

Bon voyage!

## Connect with designers at the discipline's premier event
From the rise of artificial intelligences and virtual reality to the commoditization of smart services — technology keeps redefining the relationship between us and the world where we live. Interaction 18 will offer practitioners and companies the opportunity to reflect on how we are shaping the world moving forward, by building bridges across cultures, disciplines and industries to discover shared directions and goals.

Why partner with us?

IxDA is renowned for its impressive conferences — a tradition made possible thanks to our sponsors. Interaction Week 18 is a key opportunity for our partners to reach the interaction design community and its professional stakeholders.

We expect 1000 people to join us in Lyon. Our attendees are spread across many design disciplines; interaction designers, user experience consultants, product managers, academics, but also authors of best-selling books on user experience and VPs of Fortune 1000 companies. About 35% of the attendees will be from North America, 50% from Europe and 15% from the rest of the world. About half of them work for in-house corporate design teams and the other half for agencies and consultancies.

**As well as helping us create an amazing conference, you will set your footprint in a fresh and ambitious location where interaction design rubs shoulders with many other industries: videogame, art, innovation, research... and the list goes on.**

## Venues Accessibility in France


In France it’s required for public spaces to be welcoming to everyone. As a consequence, all venues open to the public such as ours offer optimum circulation within the buildings, access ramps and proper doors, adequate signage, and more facilities.


### Musée des Confluences

Vehicles can be parked on specific dedicated spaces. The building entrance is at ground floor, where most of the party activities will take place, while escalators and elevators will provide access to the other floors. There will be availability of sitting space as well.
A simplified access with floor guiding, multimedia and tactile pieces makes all collections accessible to everyone. Unfortunately, no braille documentation is available but we can arrange a sign language accompanist if you can contact us in advance.

### La Sucrière & Le Sucre

The main conference venue has an entrance with a mild ramp and can be reached from the bus stop via a flat sidewalk. On the main floor there will be the welcome area, the main stage, and a separate calm room to get some breathing space from the cognitive load of the conference. The upper levels can be accessed by elevator, and seating will be made available in every room.

### Le Transbordeur

There are two entrances to the main ground floor area: a mild ramp and a special door for people with reduced mobility. Unfortunately the upper level with the cloakroom is not accessible, but you can ask one of our volunteers for assistance. We will provide sitting space around the venue.

## General Notes

* The bathrooms in all the venues are accessible.
* Water is going to be available during the whole event, with glass bottles spread around the venue.
* It’s possible to bring hot and cold food from the outside.
* All the venues are heated, with the exception of the Musée des Confluences main hall — the exhibitions are heated.

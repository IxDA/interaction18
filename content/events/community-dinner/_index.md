## Let’s talk, let’s eat!
### Wednesday 7 at 20:30

Lyon is rightly seen as a gastronomic capital of the world, with a history of serving some of the finest food in France. From the famous "bouchons" to the Michelin starred chefs of the city, let’s discover together this culinary excellence. 

You can join us for a community dinner for 8 groups of diners to 8 different restaurants in town on wednesday 7 at 20:30. We have handpicked a variety of restaurants, from ones that we love to go with friends everyday to famous and well-known places. As space is limited, each group can only take up to 6 attendees. Every group will be led by one local host and also include one special guest — e.g. a prominent influencer or leader in our field. 

**We expect tickets to sell out fast, so don’t think too much and join us!**

## Let’s talk, let’s eat!

Lyon has a gastronomic heritage of high quality and a taste for the pleasures of the table. From the famous "bouchons" to the starred chefs of the city, let’s discover together this culinary excellence.

You can join us to a community dinner for 8 groups of diners to 8 different restaurants in town. We have handpicked a variety of restaurants, from ones that we love to go with friends everyday to famous and well-known places. As space is limited, each group can only take up to 6 attendees. Every group will be led by one local host and also include one special guest — e.g. a prominent influencer or leader in our field.

**We expect tickets to sell out fast, so don’t think too much and join us!**

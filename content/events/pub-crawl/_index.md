## Get a drink in Vieux Lyon
**Tuesday, 6 Feb at 20:00**

Wine, beer, virgin cocktails? The best bars and pubs are located near the old center, one of the most fascinating spots in town. You will be seduced with its old chimneys, dark cobblestones and lavish doorways.

Jump from one stop to the next, bump into your fellow attendees, and get lost in the famous Traboulles - the tiny mysterious passages that connect all the ancient courtyards.

For one night, Vieux Lyon is ours!

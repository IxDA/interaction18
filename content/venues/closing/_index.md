## Closing party venue

For the closing night we move north along the Rhône. The Transbordeur, once a water treatment facility, acquired a bold new identity in 2010 that builds on its industrial past thanks to the graphic collective [Kolle Bolle](http://www.kollebolle.com/projets/transbo-identite-visuelle/).

The reputation of the Transbordeur has been established by thousands of renowned artists: The Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, Foo Fighters, Iron Maiden, Jamiroquai, New Order, Oasis, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead… and now, also us.

## Main conference venue

Our main venue is located on the southern side of Perrache station, where Rhône and Saône merge. You will join us at La Sucrière, an old sugar warehouse, the only building that was preserved when the area was entirely <a href="http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2015/02/16/the_new_lyon_city_centre.html" target="_blank">renewed in the 2000s</a> as a place of experimentation for contemporary architecture.

La Sucrière is now a renowned exhibition space, the perfect nest for the famous Lyon Biennale of Contemporary Art, the Bakery World Championship ...and now Interaction&nbsp;18.

You will walk through its historical spaces, with characteristic massive silos and a wooden rooftop, made even more peculiar by having its façade redesigned every two years: its look in 2018 will be a surprise.

Its wooden rooftop, hosting Le Sucre, a hip bar and a venue for famous DJs, will provide you a wonderful view of the rivers from its massive terrace.

## The inside

La Sucrière still preserves the industrial charm of its origins, with strong structural pillars, concrete beams, and sugar feed chutes, not to mention the massive silos on its side.

There are five different spaces. The massive Espace 1930, overlooked by a raised Mezzanine, is connected to the silos and to the adjacent Espace 1960. Above we have the Exhibition floor complemented at the very top by Le Sucre, with its terrace.

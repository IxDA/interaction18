## Opening party venue

Built on the last piece of land where the rivers Rhône and Saône meet, the museum is the perfect location to open Interaction18.

Musée des Confluences was designed by the Austrian architecture agency [Coop Himmelb(l)au](https://www.archdaily.com/585697/musee-des-confluences-coop-himmelb-l-au). Its entrance is a “crystal”, a space of glass and structural beams containing the “gravity well”, a vortex in its center. From here, you will have access to the “cloud”, the central exhibition space.

What if you don’t enjoy parties? During the opening, you will be able to access all the exhibitions in the Musée: four rooms and four visions of our human existence and civilization.

You will be able to see the temporary exhibition “Lumiere!”, showcasing the invention of the cinema.

During the night you also will be able to immerse yourself in the city through the Musée vantage point, either its open terrace or the park around it, for a relaxing – even if chilly – walk.

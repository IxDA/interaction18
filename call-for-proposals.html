		<h2>Dissolving boundaries.<br>Building connections.</h2>
		<p>Thank you for considering submitting to Interaction&nbsp;18.</p>
		<p>At Interaction&nbsp;18 we would like to reflect on the value and potential of interaction design at three different levels.</p> 
		<p><strong>Micro: details that matter</strong><br>
		What are our best practices? How can we design the tools and processes of our craft?</p>
		<p><strong>Macro: systemic transformations</strong><br>
		What are the interesting challenges we are facing today? How can we apply design for strategic and systemic change?</p>
		<p><strong>Meso: identity and vision</strong><br>
		What is our role moving forward? How can we evolve design for the long term vision and the organizations of tomorrow?</p>
		<h2>Who is your audience?</h2>
		<p>We want to set a stage for advanced, more in-depth topics, so while the conference is open to every level, the majority of the audience is going to be senior designers, tech and creative directors, thought leaders, startup founders, teachers, and beyond.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="bordered mega-padding container content container-s spacer-t-b">
		<h2>Why should you submit to Interaction&nbsp;18?</h2>
		<p>You will inspire people, impacting the discipline of interaction design. You will also meet other design leaders from all around the world. More importantly, it will be fun!</p>

				<h3>Proposing a Talk</h3>
				<img src="img/photos/cfp-talk.jpg" alt="Captivated audience at Interaction 16 in Helsinki">
				<p>We are going to do different lengths to accommodate different scopes, approaches and insights.</p>
				<p>From 7 minutes talks to describe one straightforward use-case or concept, to 15 minutes to expand over a single larger idea with examples, to 35 minutes with a very rich, full-fledged and well articulated concept or historical walkthrough.</p>

				<h3>Proposing a Workshop</h3>
				<img src="img/photos/cfp-workshop.jpg" alt="Workshop happening at Interaction 16 in Helsinki">
				<p>In the workshops, we’d like you to go one step further and consider an already experienced audience and do deep-dives in the topic from the very beginning.</p>
				<p>We’re going to have a mix of short (4h) and long (8h) workshops. You’ll be guiding your class through a deep dive into a specific topic, with a strong mix of hands-on exercises and frontal lectures.</p>

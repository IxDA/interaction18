					<strong>Eager to speak at Interaction&nbsp;18?</strong>
				</p>

		<section class="container content container-xs spacer-t-b">
			<p>Thank you for considering submitting to Interaction&nbsp;18. </p>
			<h2>Dissolving boundaries.<br>Building connections.</h2>
			<p>At Interaction&nbsp;18 we want to engage a diverse group of speakers to come to Lyon and share their reflections and provocations on the value and potential of interaction design, shaping a collective point of view that looks at the maturity, meaning and evolution of our practice. <br>
			We propose three different levels for this deep conversation:
			</p>
			<p><strong>Micro: details that matter</strong><br>
			Interaction design is always about sorting out the small details that make the overall experience better and unique. <br>
			What are our best practices? What  technologies, tools and processes are mastering our craft? </p>
			<p><strong>Meso: systemic transformations</strong><br>
			Interaction design is more and more often at the heart of transformation processes that invests companies, institutions and the entire society.<br>
			What are the most difficult challenges we should tackle? How can we apply design for strategic and systemic change?
			</p>
			<p><strong>Macro: identity and vision</strong><br>
			Interaction design is playing an essential role in defining what human life could become, considering the potential of existing technologies and their endless applications. <br>
			What are our responsibilities moving forward? How can we evolve our thinking, skills and mindset to actively shape the long term vision?
			</p>
			<h2>Who is our audience?</h2>
			<p>We want to set a stage for advanced, more in-depth topics, so while the conference is open to every level, the majority of the audience is going to be senior designers, tech and creative directors, thought leaders, startup founders, teachers, and beyond.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="bordered mega-padding container content container-s spacer-t-b">
			<h2>Why should you submit to Interaction&nbsp;18?</h2>
			<p>You will inspire people, and help shape the discipline of interaction design. You will also meet other design leaders from all around the world. More importantly, it will be fun!</p>

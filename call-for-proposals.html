		<h2>Dissolving boundaries.<br>Building connections.</h2>
		<p>Thank you for considering submitting to Interaction&nbsp;18. </p>
		<p>At Interaction&nbsp;18 we would like to reflect on the value and potential of interaction design at three different levels.</p> 
		<p><strong>Micro: details that matter</strong><br>
		What are our best practices? How can we design the tools and processes of our craft?</p>
		<p><strong>Macro: systemic transformations</strong><br>
		What are the most difficult challenges we are facing today? How can we apply design for strategic and systemic change?</p>
		<p><strong>Meso: identity and vision</strong><br>
		What is our role moving forward? How can we evolve design for the long term vision and the people and organizations of tomorrow?</p>
		<h2>Who is our audience?</h2>
		<p>We want to set a stage for advanced, more in-depth topics, so while the conference is open to every level, the majority of the audience is going to be senior designers, tech and creative directors, thought leaders, startup founders, teachers, and beyond.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="bordered mega-padding container content container-s spacer-t-b">
		<h2>Why should you submit to Interaction&nbsp;18?</h2>
		<p>You will inspire people, and help shape the discipline of interaction design. You will also meet other design leaders from all around the world. More importantly, it will be fun!</p>

				<p>We are seeking different length talks to accommodate different scopes, approaches and insights.</p>
				<p>From 7 minutes talks to describe one straightforward use-case or concept, to 15 minutes to expand over a single larger idea with examples, to 35 minutes with a very rich, full-fledged and well articulated concept or historical walkthrough.</p>

				<h3>Proposing a Workshop</h3>
